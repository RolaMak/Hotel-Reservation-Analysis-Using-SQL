# Hotel-Reservation-Analysis-Using-SQL
Our project enhanced hotel guest experiences through SQL data analysis. We imported Excel files to MS SQL, identified booking trends, and recommended optimizations. Leveraging data insights, we improved guest satisfaction and operational efficiency in the hospitality sector.

#The hotel industry relies on data to make informed decisions and provide a better guest experience. In
this internship, you will work with a hotel reservation dataset to gain insights into guest preferences,
booking trends, and other key factors that impact the hotel's operations. You will use SQL to query and
analyze the data, as well as answer specific questions about the dataset.
